This paper quantifies the local economic impact of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that were established in India between 2005-2013. Based on a novel data set that combines
census data on the universe of Indian firms with georeferenced data on SEZs, we find that
SEZs increased manufacturing and service employment with positive spillover effects up to
10km. This employment gain was paralleled by a decline in local agricultural employment,
in particular of women, suggesting that the policy contributed to structural change. We find
no evidence for heterogeneous effects between privately and publicly run SEZs or zones with
different industry denominations.

This paper shows that bargaining over tax payments is an important feature of tax
compliance and enforcement in lower income countries. Analyzing the universe of
administrative tax filings from Zambia, we document sharp bunching in (i) dominated regions above tax schedule discontinuities, inconsistent with standard models of tax compliance and (ii) at round number tax payments, implying that certain payments are being targeted. Additional evidence from our own survey suggests
that discussing tax payments with tax officials before filing taxes is widespread, consistent with tax payments being the outcomes of bargaining. Such bargaining over taxes is consistent with fact (ii), as bargaining outcomes are often round and salient numbers, and with fact (i), because tax schedule discontinuities restrict the set of
feasible bargaining outcomes. Finally, we generalize the conventional Allingham & Sandmo (1972) model to allow for bargaining as a mode of tax compliance. We show that bargaining leads to Pareto-improvements for both taxpayers and the state as long as state capacity is sufficiently low.

  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Carbon taxation and firm behavior in emerging economies: Evidence from South Africa </font>

  (with Johannes Gallé, Rodrigo Oliveira, Nadine Riedel and Edson Severnini)<br />
  <b> <i> UNU-WIDER grant (USD 10,000) </i> </b> </summary>
  
This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of how firms in emerging economies
respond to carbon taxation, leveraging detailed administrative data from South Africa –
a potential trailblazer for other developing countries with limited state capacity amid the
growing global push for carbon pricing. We examine the dynamic impacts of the carbon tax
on firm-level outcomes – such as profits, sales, capital, and labor inputs – across manufac-
turing and mining firms, which are key sectors in the context of the carbon tax. Contrary to
concerns that carbon taxes may hinder economic growth or reduce employment, our findings
show no evidence of negative average impacts on firm performance or jobs. However, this
overall result masks significant heterogeneity in the tax’s effects across sectors, driven by
the sector-specific design elements of the South African carbon tax. Firms expecting higher
effective tax rates may have intensified their use of emission-intensive machinery and depre-
ciated capital in anticipation of the tax. This behavior appears to stem from firms resolving
regulatory uncertainty or seeking to recover costs from stranded assets.

  <summary markdown="span"><font color="blue">Taxing FDI in a developing economy: the case of informality</font>
<br />
 </summary>
  
This paper introduces a new model which captures the eff ect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on a developing economy with an informal sector. The informal sector evolves endogenously as economic agents choose between working and setting up a firm and whether to do so formally or informally. FDI induces a uniform increase in labor costs but heterogenous productivity increases for domestic formal firms. Accordingly, some of these fi rms may opt for informality with increased FDI. This reduction in the domestic tax base may off set any revenue gains from additional FDI. It is shown that the revenue-neutral tax rate on FDI is decreasing in the government’s efficiency in screening tax avoidance, as more efficient governments are able to attenuate the increase in informality. The empirical analysis supports the key conclusions of the
model.
