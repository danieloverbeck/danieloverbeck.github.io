  (with Eliya Lungu) <br />
  <b> <i> Job Market Paper </i> </b> </summary>
  
This paper shows that bargaining over tax payments is an important feature of tax compliance and enforcement in lower income countries. Analyzing the universe of administrative tax filings from Zambia, we document sharp bunching in (i) dominated
regions above tax schedule discontinuities and (ii) at round number tax payments (not necessarily round turnover). Additional evidence from our own survey suggests that discussing tax payments with tax officials before filing taxes is widespread, consistent with tax payments being the outcomes of bargaining. Such bargaining over taxes is consistent with fact (ii), as bargaining outcomes are often round and salient numbers and with fact (i), because tax schedule discontinuities restrict the set of feasible bargaining outcomes. In contrast, alternative explanations based on audit probabilities, optimization frictions, and mistakes cannot rationalize the bunching patterns and are inconsistent with additional experimental survey evidence. Finally, we generalize the conventional Allingham & Sandmo (1972) model to allow for bargaining as a mode of tax compliance. We show that bargaining leads to Pareto-improvements for both taxpayers and the state as long as state capacity is sufficiently low.

  (with <a href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/ueber-uns/team/galle-johannes.html" target="_blank"> Johannes Gallé </a> ,  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/riedeleconomics/welcome" target="_blank">Nadine Riedel</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tobiasseideluni/home-1" target="_blank">Tobias Seidel</a>) <br />

This paper quantifies the local economic impact of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) that were established in India between 2005-2013. Based on a novel data set that combines
census data on the universe of Indian firms with georeferenced data on SEZs, we find that
SEZs increased manufacturing and service employment with positive spillover effects up to
10km. This employment gain was paralleled by a decline in local agricultural employment,
in particular of women, suggesting that the policy contributed to structural change. We find
no evidence for heterogeneous effects between privately and publicly run SEZs or zones with
different industry denominations.
